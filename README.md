# Feels Like 45

A paired programming project by Laura Chuang and Derek Murr.

Makes use of the City of Toronto's Open Data Initiative; makes an API call to get an up-to-date list of every cooling centre the City opens for relief when a Dangerous Heat Alert is declared. Using map data from OpenStreetMaps displayed with Leaflet.js, we display markers on a map for each location and also list names/addresses/phone numbers for each location. The user can filter the list down by selecting one of the city's boroughs, and can center the map on a location either by dragging/zooming the map and clicking a marker, or by clicking a location name in the list. Also makes an API call to Dark Sky to get the current temperature conditions in Toronto.
